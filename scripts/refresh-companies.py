"""
refresh-companies.py — re-verify every live NYC engineering posting and
rewrite the COMPANIES block in js/data.js in place.

What it does
------------
For every candidate company in CANDIDATES below, hits the company's
public ATS JSON (Ashby / Greenhouse / Lever / Workable / Workday /
Teamtailor / SmartRecruiters) via curl, filters jobs by:

  • Location contains "New York" / NYC / Brooklyn / Manhattan
  • Title matches an SDE / SWE / Forward Deployed / Founding /
    Applied AI/ML / Member-of-Technical-Staff pattern
  • Title does NOT contain staff / principal / lead / manager /
    director / intern / research scientist / sales-or-solutions /
    customer / partner / implementation engineer

For each company with ≥1 surviving posting, it emits a record with
all matching jobs (sorted founding > senior > mid) and the funding
metadata declared in CANDIDATES. The full set replaces the COMPANIES
const in js/data.js. The verified-on date is bumped to today.

Use this whenever postings go stale. Links rot — that's expected;
this script is the recovery path.

How to add a new company
------------------------
Append to CANDIDATES (tuple format below). The ATS slug must be the
exact slug the company uses on Ashby or Greenhouse — e.g.,
  https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}            -> ("ashby", slug)
  https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}    -> ("greenhouse", slug)
If a company doesn't survive the location/role filters, the script
silently drops it. Run with -v to see no-match diagnostics.
